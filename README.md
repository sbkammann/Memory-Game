# Memory Game

This game consists of a 4 x 4 card grid with the backs facing the user. The aim of the game is to uncover the cards and match all cards. If the user finds a match the cards stay uncovered. If not they flip back around.
There is a 3 star skill rating. 3 being the best. 1 the worst. The more moves the user makes the worse the rating. Once the user has completed the game they are taken to a screen that
proclaims they have won. There is also a button that allows them to play again.

**Note:** To test how responsive the game it is necessary to refresh the page after resizing the browser window as the grid does not respond to window size after setup.

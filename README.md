# Memory Game

The memory game board has a 4 x 4 card grid with the backs facing the user. There are eight pairs randomly arranged on the board with the symbol facing down.

## How to play

Click on a card to uncover the symbol. Click another to uncover it as well and see if it matches. If it matches both cards stay flipped over. If they do not match they flip over again.
The aim of the game is to match all symbols. Once the user has completed the game they are taken to a screen that proclaims they have won. There is also a button that allows them to play again.

**Note:** There is a 3 star skill rating. 3 being the best. 1 the worst. The more moves the user makes the worse the rating.
